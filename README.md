# Traffic-Pollution-Monitoring-and-Prediction-System-IoT
Vehicular pollution has a major role in degrading the environmental system. The
level of traffic pollution has increased with time due to a lot of factors like the increase in
population, increased vehicle use etc. which results in harmful effects on human beings by
directly affecting health of population. In this project, we focus on traffic pollution
monitoring. Every vehicle has a standard of emission of gases, but the difficulty occurs
when the emission is beyond the standardized values. This emission from vehicles cannot
be completely avoided, but it can be definitely controlled. The aim of our project will be to
monitor the pollutants at traffic signals using the pollution detection circuit. This pollution
detection circuit will consist of various sensors like gas sensor(CO), temperature sensor,
humidity sensor etc. and are connected to a Microcontroller(Arduino) which gives us
various environmental data. The data collected by the detection circuit is sent via a wifi
module to a web-server, from where it is used for various analytical purposes which gives
us qualitative data about pollution.
